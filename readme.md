## Abstract 

The Student Community Application is a web application that aims to create a localised and concentrated community of students from a college. 
The project would achieve this in the form of a Community Question Answering(CQA) forum that is formed at the college level.The bigger forums available in the market serve a more general purpose and cover a vast variety of topics on a global level.Most questions that are based on a local community level can not be asked on these platforms or simply remain unanswered as the query is pertaining to a smaller group of people and is irrelevant to the majority of users. This project would give students a platform to voice their questions, pool their knowledge and help each other grow.
